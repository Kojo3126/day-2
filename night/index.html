        Gary is a sea snail with a pink shell which depicts purplish-dark blue spots and a red spiral.
         He has eye antennas that hold together his scarlet-green eyes with orangish-red pupils.
          The sides of his body are light blue and his belly is green.

          He is typically known to create trails of slime when crawling. In addition to this, it is known that Gary has feet, as shown in "Your Shoe's Untied" and "SpongeBob's Last Stand."Being a snail, which are to Bikini Bottom what cats are to the real world, Gary is only able to communicate by saying "Meow."

      Gary is known for his characteristic "meow"â€” in contrast to the barking of the sea worms, suggesting that snails like Gary are equivalent tod cats and that worms are equivalent to dogs. It has been known for Gary to say things other than "meow," such as in "The Secret Box" and The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, for example. In "Your Shoe's Untied," "Frozen Face-Off," "Squid Defense," and The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water, he is shown to be able to roar.

      Much like real cats, Gary hates taking baths, as seen in "Gary Takes a Bath," "Pet Sitter Pat," and "Shellback Shenanigans." In the second of the three, Patrick wants to wash Gary and later uses a hose to do so. In the former, SpongeBob used many methods like offering a free dollar, Boomerang Pet Ball, etc.
